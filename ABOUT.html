		<h1>History of the Company</h1>
	<p>Lifting heavy weights was a popular activity in Ancient India, Persia, Egypt, China, and Greece, among other regions. 
	Of these areas, we are going to focus exclusively on Ancient Greece and India. 
It is thanks to Ancient Athens that we have the very word gymnasium.The wordâ€™s origins are derived from the Greek terms gumnazo (exercise) and gumnos (naked or loin-clothed). 
Taken literally, the word means naked exercise, which provides a hint as to the kind of exercise undertaken in the gymnasium.</p>
